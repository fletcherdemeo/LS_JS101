// Egyptian Fractions
// A Rational Number is any number that can be represented as the result of the
// division between two integers, e.g., 1/3, 3/2, 22/7, etc. The number to the
// left is called the numerator, and the number to the right is called the
// denominator.

// A Unit Fraction is a rational number where the numerator is 1.

// An Egyptian Fraction is the sum of a series of distinct unit fractions (no
// two are the same), such as:

// 1   1    1    1
// - + - + -- + --
// 2   3   13   15

// Every positive rational number can be written as an Egyptian fraction. For
// example:

//     1   1   1   1
// 2 = - + - + - + -
//     1   2   3   6

// Write two functions: one that takes a Rational number as an argument, and
// returns an Array of the denominators that are part of an Egyptian Fraction
// representation of the number, and another that takes an Array of numbers
// in the same format, and calculates the resulting Rational number.

// Code

    if (unitFraction <= targetValue) {
      targetValue = targetValue.sub(unitFraction);
      denominators.push(unitDenominator);
    }

// Examples:

console.log(egyptian(new Fraction(2, 1))); // -> [1, 2, 3, 6]
console.log(egyptian(new Fraction(137, 60))); // -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(egyptian(new Fraction(3, 1))); // -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 230, 57960]

console.log(unegyptian(egyptian(new Fraction(1, 2)))); // logs 0.5
console.log(unegyptian(egyptian(new Fraction(3, 4)))); // logs 0.75
console.log(unegyptian(egyptian(new Fraction(39, 20)))); // logs 1.95
console.log(unegyptian(egyptian(new Fraction(127, 130)))); // logs 0.9769230769230768
console.log(unegyptian(egyptian(new Fraction(5, 7)))); // logs 0.7142857142857142
console.log(unegyptian(egyptian(new Fraction(1, 1)))); // logs 1
console.log(unegyptian(egyptian(new Fraction(2, 1)))); // logs 2
console.log(unegyptian(egyptian(new Fraction(3, 1)))); // logs 3

// Every rational number can be expressed as an Egyptian Fraction. In fact,
// every rational number can be expressed as an Egyptian Fraction in an infinite
// number of different ways. Thus, the first group of examples may not show the
// same values as your solution. They do, however, show the expected form of the
// solution. The remaining examples merely demonstrate that the output of egyptian
// can be reversed by unegyptian.
